    <h4> Ideation: </h4>
    As a college student myself, coming back or going to the airport after breaks is really troublesome. It costs a lot to uber/lyft/whatever such long distance. Right before college students were heading back to school on January, I saw many posts on Facebook groups something like: "Can anyone going to Berkeley on the 14th share uber with me?", I thought it would be nice to have a website with all that ride requests together.

    <h4> So what does it do? </h4>
    As you enter your information, it will display a list of people going to the same direction as you. This is how it will look like. Next to each ride results, you can send message to that person if you want to share a ride with him/her.

    <h4> What now? </h4>
    I am currently trying to optimize this search functionality for better user experience. Also I got some feedbacks from people who have been using it, so I am looking forward to release the next version before Spring break! (yes, when everyone is again heading to the airport)
